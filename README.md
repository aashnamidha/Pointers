# Pointers
## Aim
To swap two numbers using call by value and call by reference.
## Description
In call by reference method, the aruguments to the functions are the pointers to the variables wherease in call by value the arguments are the variables themseleves.
In this program two numbers have been swapped using call by value and call by reference method. In call by value the swapping is done inside the function however there is no alteration in the main(). In call by reference the address of the two variables/numbers has been swapped thus the swapping takes place in the main() function as well.
